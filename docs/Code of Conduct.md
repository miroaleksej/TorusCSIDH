# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of TorusCSIDH, we pledge to foster an open, inclusive, and professional environment that prioritizes security, mathematical rigor, and collaborative progress in post-quantum cryptography. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of personal characteristics, with special attention to the high-stakes nature of cryptographic development.

Given the critical security implications of our work, we recognize that respectful, precise, and evidence-based discourse is essential for building trustworthy cryptographic systems that will protect Bitcoin against quantum threats.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Professional Communication**: Using clear, precise language when discussing complex cryptographic concepts
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Providing proofs, references, or evidence for technical claims
- **Security Mindfulness**: Approaching discussions with awareness of potential security implications
- **Constructive Feedback**: Offering specific, actionable suggestions for improvement
- **Respect for Expertise**: Acknowledging specialized knowledge in cryptography, mathematics, and security
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Following proper channels for reporting security issues
- **Patience with Complexity**: Understanding that post-quantum cryptography involves advanced mathematics

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Security Endangerment**: Publishing or encouraging disclosure of potential vulnerabilities without following responsible disclosure procedures
- **Mathematical Dismissiveness**: Dismissing valid mathematical arguments without substantive counter-evidence
- **Technical Misrepresentation**: Making false claims about cryptographic security properties
- **Harassment or Intimidation**: Any behavior intended to threaten, belittle, or exclude others
- **Unverified Security Claims**: Making definitive statements about security properties without proper verification
- **Plagiarism of Research**: Failing to credit prior work in isogeny-based cryptography
- **Rushed Implementation**: Pressuring for implementation of unverified mathematical approaches

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Communication channels (Discord, Telegram, email lists)
- Conferences or meetups where participants identify as TorusCSIDH contributors
- Any other spaces managed by the TorusCSIDH project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at miro-aleksej@yandex.ru. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers will take appropriate action in response to verified violations, which may include:
- A private, written warning
- Temporary removal of repository access
- Permanent removal from project spaces
- Public disclosure of violations (for security-critical misconduct)

Maintainers who fail to follow this Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent removal from the project leadership.

All reporters and those reporting violations will be protected from retaliation.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to violations
- Maintaining confidentiality when appropriate
- Documenting incidents and actions taken
- Periodically reviewing enforcement practices

**Important Security Notice**: As a cryptographic project handling security-critical code, all contributors must follow our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](SECURITY.md). Any attempt to exploit, demonstrate, or publicize potential vulnerabilities outside of our established channels will result in immediate removal from the project and may have legal consequences.
